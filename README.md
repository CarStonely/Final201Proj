# Minesweeper ðŸŒ±ðŸ’£

Welcome to your laid-back Java Minesweeper clone! This project started as a CSE-201 assignment and has grown into a simple, fun little game you can run in two modes: GUI or text-based. No pressureâ€”just dig around for mines and try not to blow up!

## Whatâ€™s Inside

- **`BoardModel.java`** â€“ Holds the grid, places mines, tracks flags & reveals  
- **`Cell.java`** â€“ Represents each square on the board  
- **`GameController.java`** â€“ Game logic glue between model and views  
- **`GUIView.java` / `TextView.java`** â€“ Two different ways to play  
- **`Launcher.java`** â€“ Pick your poison: GUI or text, regular or testing mode  
- **`TestBoardValidator.java`** â€“ Some quick tests to make sure your board behaves

## Quick Start

1. **Compile everything**  
   ```bash
   javac *.java

2. Running the Launcher
# GUI mode
java Launcher gui

# Text mode (console-only)
java Launcher text

How to Play
Reveal a cell:

GUI: Left-click

Text: Type r x y (e.g. r 3 5)

Flag / unflag a cell:

GUI: Right-click

Text: Type f x y (e.g. f 3 5)

Win by uncovering all non-mine cells

Lose by stepping on a mineâ€”boom! ðŸ’¥
