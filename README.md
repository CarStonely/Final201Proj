# Java Minesweeper Game ðŸŒ±ðŸ’£

Welcome to your laid-back Java Minesweeper clone! This project started as a CSE-201 assignment and has grown into a simple, fun little game you can run in two modes: GUI or text-based. No pressureâ€”just dig around for mines and try not to blow up!

## Whatâ€™s Inside

- **`BoardModel.java`** â€“ Manages the grid, places mines, tracks flags, and reveals cells.  
- **`Cell.java`** â€“ Represents each square on the board.  
- **`GameController.java`** â€“ Connects the game logic between the model and views.  
- **`GUIView.java` / `TextView.java`** â€“ Two different ways to play: graphical or text-based.  
- **`Launcher.java`** â€“ Allows you to choose between GUI or text mode, and regular or testing mode.  
- **`TestBoardValidator.java`** â€“ Provides quick tests to validate board behavior.
